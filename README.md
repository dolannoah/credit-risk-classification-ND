Overview: 
The goal of this analysis was to build a machine learning model that can predict the risk level of loans. 
Specifically, we used a logistic regression model to classify loans as either healthy or high-risk. 
This helps financial institutions make better decisions when approving or rejecting loan applications.

Results:
- Accuracy: 0.99
- Precision for class 0: 1.00
- Recall for class 0: 0.99
- Precision for class 1 (high-risk loans): 0.84
- Recall for class 1: 0.94

Summary:
The logistic regression model performs very well overall, especially in predicting healthy loans. 
It also does a strong job of identifying high-risk loans, with a high recall score of 0.94. 
Based on these results, I recommend using this model, as it accurately detects both safe and risky loans, helping reduce financial risk for the company.
